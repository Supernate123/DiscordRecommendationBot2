# SPLITTING THE DATA FOR TRAINING AND TESTING
# In machine learning, we always need to test if our model works on data it hasn't seen before
# We split the data into two sets:
#   1. Training set: Used to train the model (teach it the patterns)
#   2. Test set: Used to evaluate how well the model works on new, unseen data

# Here we put 30% of data in the training set and 70% in the test set
# In real applications, you'd usually use more data for training (like 80% train, 20% test)
trainset, testset = train_test_split(dataset, test_size=0.2)


# USING SVD (SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION) FOR RECOMMENDATIONS
# SVD is a matrix factorization technique that finds hidden patterns in data
# It tries to find those hidden features that explain why users rate items the way they do

# Configure the SVD algorithm
algo = SVD(
    n_factors=50,  # Look for 12 hidden features
    n_epochs=50,  # Run the optimization process 100 times to improve accuracy
    biased=False  # Don't consider user and item biases (keeping it simple)
)

# TRAINING THE MODEL
# This is where the learning happens! The algorithm analyzes the training data
# to discover patterns and relationships between users, items, and ratings
print("\nTraining the SVD model...")
algo.fit(trainset)


# MAKING PREDICTIONS
# Now we test the trained model on data it hasn't seen before
# This shows how well it can predict real user ratings
print("Making predictions on test set...")
predictions = algo.test(testset)

# EVALUATING MODEL PERFORMANCE
# RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) measures the average prediction error
# Lower RMSE = better predictions (the model is more accurate)
rmse = accuracy.rmse(predictions)
